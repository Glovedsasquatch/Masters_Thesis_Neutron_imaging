The folder receives five output files:
1) Simulated high resolution output
2) Smoothed high resolution output: image generated in integration mode of the Gaussian events on high resolution
3) Super-resolution image: using biased numerical algorithm
4) Super-resolution image with Fixed Patter Noise adjusted: using unbiased numerical algorithm
5) Detector Image

The files should be removed after every subsequent run inorder to avoid being overwritten. Usually, it can be copied to the Comparison_results folder.
